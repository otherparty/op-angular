    <p>We’ve got AI in our corner, tracking the bills and policies that shape our lives, dissecting the details, and
      distilling them down to what matters. We don’t feed you answers or tell you what to think. We give you the tools,
      the
      facts, the context, and then we let you run with it.</p>

    <p>You’ll find no fluff here. This is political news stripped to the bone, built for
      sharing,
      talking, challenging, and celebrating. We’re here for the people who don’t want a filter, who believe
      that
      thinking for yourself is a lot more interesting than picking a side.</p>
